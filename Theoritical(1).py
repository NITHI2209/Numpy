Numpy --> Numerical python 
It is a powerfu; python library for handling large, multi dimensional arrays and performing mathematical operations efficiently 

Why use Numpy?
1)Fast & Efficient : Numpy operations are much faster than regular python lists
2)Multi dimensional arrays: Support 1D,2D and n-dimensional arrays(nd arrays)
3)Broadcasting : Perform operations on arrays of different shapes without looping 

Installing Numpy
"pip install numpy" 

import numpy as np
print(np.__version__)
